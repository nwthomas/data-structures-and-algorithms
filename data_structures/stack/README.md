# Stack 🧶

A `Stack` is a unique structure that operates on a "first-in, last-out" priority schedule.

A typical `Stack` will have two basic operations in addition to storing data, which are pushing
data to the top of the `Stack` and popping data off the top of the `Stack`.

## TYPE

A `Stack` is an abstract data structure and is open at the top; it allows data to enter and exit from the top of the `Stack`.

## DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION

A `Stack` is a data structure that stores data in a "first-in, first-out" fashion. In other words, any value stored first in a `Stack` will then be the last value to be removed.

## SPACE AND TIME COMPLEXITY

A `Stack` is relatively easy to make performant to a time complexity `O(1)` standard.

Space complexity is always `O(n)` and dependant on the amount of information stored.
