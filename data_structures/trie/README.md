# Trie ðŸŒ²

A `Trie` is a unique data structure that operates a bit like a `Tree` but has a multitude of children for every single node. It is often used for the efficient storage and retrieval of keys in a dataset of strings.

A typeical `Trie` will have `insert`, `search`, `remove`, and `update` operations. The one in this repo has also been extended with a `searchPrefix` method.
