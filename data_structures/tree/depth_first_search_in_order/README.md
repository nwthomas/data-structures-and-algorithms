# DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH IN-ORDER üíÇüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This searching process searching in a depth-first search in-order pattern across a `tree` data structure.

This means that the search will go deep on the set of nodes traversing down the lefthand side on each tree branch and then once, that's exhausted, visit each node and then traverse down the righthand side while visiting each node and repeating this pattern.

## TYPE

While not technically a data strucure all on its own, this is merely a manner of searching through any sort of `tree` for a certain value.

## DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION

See above [Type](#type) section.

## SPACE AND TIME COMPLEXITY

The runtime complexity for a depth-first search algorithm is `O(n)` where `n = number of nodes`. The space complexity can vary depending on implementation, but could potentially be `O(n)` where `n = number of nodes`.
