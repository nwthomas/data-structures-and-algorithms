## TYPE

While not technically a data strucure all on its own, this is merely a manner of searching through any sort of `tree` for a certain value.

## DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION

See above [Type](#type) section.

## SPACE AND TIME COMPLEXITY

The runtime complexity for a breadth-first search algorithm is `O(n)` where `n = number of nodes`. The space complexity can vary depending on needs, but could potentially be `O(n)` where `n = number of nodes`.
